Purpose
-------
Validate that pcap-file.delete-when-done=non-alerts preserves the input PCAP
when an alert is generated by a standard rule match.

The rule matches HTTP traffic containing "testmyids.com" in the Host header.
The PCAP contains a matching HTTP request, so one alert is expected (sid 2).
Because an alert is present, the PCAP file must NOT be deleted.
