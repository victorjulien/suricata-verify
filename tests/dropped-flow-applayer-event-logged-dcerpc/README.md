Test
====

It seems that Suricata will log an applayer event for a dropped flow, for the
second packet of the flow. This test demonstrates such behavior, so we can
investigate it.

This test demonstrates this behavior with the DCERPC protocol.


PCAP
====

PCAP reused from existing test `dceprc-3109`.
